# ML App for Car Price Calculation
A toy AI project that predicts a car price using an AI model trained on a public automobile dataset [1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toramky/automobile-dataset/). The idea is people who wants to buy a car of a certain brand to select its parameters to define some car parameters and how much many will cost. The App is deployed in the cloud and everyone can use it a preliminary market research. 

Besides AI algorithms we apply statistic component analysis to determine precisely  price of the car the user wants to know.
